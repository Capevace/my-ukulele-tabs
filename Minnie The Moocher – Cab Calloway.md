[Verse 1]
     Em
Well Folks, here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher,
C7                   B7      Em
  She was a low-down hoochie-cootcher,
Em
  She was the roughest, toughest frail, 
    C7                    B7       Em
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale. 

[Chorus]
      Em
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi!)
      Em
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! (Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho!)
      Em
He-de-he-de-he-de-he! (He-de-he-de-he-de-he!)
      Em
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho!)

[Verse 2]
Em
  She messed around with a bloke named Smoky,
C7                     B7     Em
  She loved him though he was cokie, 
Em
  He took her down to Chinatown, 
       C7                         B7    Em
And he showed her how to kick the gong around.
 

[Chorus]
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi!)
      Whoooooaaaaah!  (Whoooooaaaaah!)
He-de-he-de-he-de-he! (He-de-he-de-he-de-he!)
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho!)

[Verse 3]
Em
  She had a dream about the king of Sweden,
C7                        B7      Em
  He gave her things that she was needin',
Em
  He gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
((DOUBLE TIME))
  C7                 B7       Em
A diamond car with a platinum wheel. 

[Chorus]
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi!)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! (Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-hi!)
Sctuttlibu...

[Verse 4]

Em
  He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
C7                        B7    Em
  Each meal she ate was a dozen courses; 
Em
  She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
    C7                                B7      Em
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

[Chorus]
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi!)
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! (Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho!)
He-de-he-de-he-de-he! (He-de-he-de-he-de-he!)
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho! (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho!)

[Outro]
Em      C7
Poor    Min,    
C7      B7
Poor    Min,    
Em7/G   Em   (Hold to end)
Poor    Min.
